## Platform Overview

Data Quality Checker is a web-based tool that offers an instant analysis of your Excel datasets. Whether you have large datasets or small tables, our tool evaluates missing data points, duplicates, and more to provide both a bird's-eye view and a granular understanding of your data's quality.

## Getting Started

### Uploading Your Data
1. Navigate to the main dashboard of the Data Quality Checker.
2. Click on the 'Upload' button or drag and drop your Excel file into the designated area.
3. Ensure the file is either `.xlsx` or `.xls` format for compatibility.
4. Hit 'Submit' to initiate the analysis.

### Reviewing The Dashboard
Once your file is processed, you'll be redirected to the results dashboard. Here, you'll find an array of data quality metrics ranging from general insights to detailed column-wise evaluations.

## Data Quality Metrics Explained

- **Total Values**: The cumulative count of data points in your uploaded file.
- **Missing Values**: Indicates the number of data points that are absent or null.
- **Unique Values**: Reflects the variation in your data by counting distinct entries.
- **Duplicated Values**: Denotes instances where data entries are repeated.

## Interpreting the Results

1. **General Metrics**: At the top, you'll see a summary of the dataset's overall health. This provides a quick snapshot to gauge the cleanliness of your data.
2. **Column-wise Metrics**: Delve deeper with a detailed breakdown for each column. This section is pivotal for datasets with diverse columns, as it pinpoints specific areas (or columns) that might need attention.
3. **Visual Graphs**: (If implemented) Graphical representations can provide a visual understanding of the metrics, making anomalies or concerns immediately apparent.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **File Not Uploading**: Double-check the file format. If it's not `.xlsx` or `.xls`, the platform won't support it.
- **Metrics Not Displaying**: Ensure that your Excel file isn't empty or corrupted. Try opening it on your local machine to confirm.
- **Server Downtime**: On rare occasions, the server might be under maintenance or facing issues. If the platform isn't responsive, we recommend trying again after some time.
